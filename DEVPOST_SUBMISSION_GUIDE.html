                    Simon's audience loves productivity, great design, and building systems—and he wants to bring
                    coaching to more people. I noticed that busy professionals struggle to access expert guidance across
                    multiple life domains due to cost barriers ($5,000+/year for traditional coaching), time
                    constraints, and fragmented solutions. I wanted to create a clean, minimal mobile app where users
                    can get instant, expert-level coaching across fitness, career, mindfulness, relationships, finance,
                    and productivity—all in one place, with zero complexity.

                        Nirvan is a minimalist AI coaching platform that provides 6 specialized AI coaches, each trained
                        for specific life domains. Unlike generic AI assistants, each coach has a distinct personality,
                        expertise, and coaching methodology.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Frontend:</strong> Built with React Native (v0.74.5) and Expo SDK (v51) for
                        cross-platform mobile development. Used Expo Router for file-based navigation and TypeScript for
                        type safety. The minimalist UI uses React Native StyleSheet with custom design tokens, React
                        Native Reanimated for smooth 60fps animations, and thoughtful spacing that creates a premium,
                        uncluttered experience.

                    <p>
                        <strong>AI Integration:</strong> Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 API. Each coach has a specialized
                        system prompt that defines its personality, expertise, and coaching methodology. The AI service
                        handles conversation context, maintains chat history, and delivers expert-level responses
                        tailored to each domain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Monetization:</strong> Integrated RevenueCat SDK for seamless subscription management.
                        Configured with a freemium model (5 messages per coach free, then $9.99/month for unlimited
                        access). RevenueCat handles receipt validation, entitlement management, and cross-platform
                        subscription syncing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Data Storage:</strong> Used AsyncStorage for local data persistence. All conversations
                        are stored on-device for complete privacy—no cloud storage, no analytics, no data sharing.

                        <strong>CI/CD:</strong> Automated iOS builds using GitHub Actions and EAS Build. The workflow

                        deployment—all triggered via workflow dispatch.

                        <strong>RevenueCat Configuration:</strong> Initially encountered Error 23 due to missing App
                        Store Connect configuration. Had to properly set up the App-Specific Shared Secret, configure
                        products in both App Store Connect and RevenueCat, and create the correct offering structure.
                        The debugging process taught me the importance of matching product IDs and bundle identifiers
                        exactly.

                    <p>
                        <strong>AI Prompt Engineering:</strong> Creating distinct personalities for each coach required
                        extensive prompt engineering. Each coach needed to feel like a real expert in their domain while
                        maintaining a consistent, helpful tone. Balancing specificity with flexibility was
                        challenging—coaches needed to provide actionable advice without being overly prescriptive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Minimalist Design Implementation:</strong> Achieving a truly minimalist design that
                        still felt feature-rich required careful attention to spacing, typography, and animation timing.
                        Every pixel mattered—too much whitespace felt empty, too little felt cluttered. Finding the
                        right balance took multiple iterations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>State Management:</strong> Managing conversation state across multiple coaches, tracking
                        message counts for the freemium model, and syncing premium status required careful context
                        architecture. Used React Context API to avoid prop drilling while keeping the state logic clean
                        and maintainable.

                        <strong>Zero-Friction Experience:</strong> I'm most proud of achieving true zero-friction
                        onboarding. Users can open the app and start getting expert coaching in under 5 seconds—no
                        account creation, no forms, no barriers. This perfectly embodies Simon's vision of "no complex
                        setup, just guidance at the right moment."

                    <p>
                        <strong>Minimalist Design Execution:</strong> The app feels premium and polished despite being
                        built in a short timeframe. Clean typography, thoughtful spacing, smooth animations—every detail
                        contributes to an experience that Simon's design-conscious audience will appreciate.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Seamless RevenueCat Integration:</strong> Successfully implemented a complete
                        subscription flow with proper entitlement checking, paywall presentation, and purchase handling.
                        The freemium model works flawlessly, and the $9.99/month pricing delivers incredible value
                        (replacing $5,000+/year in traditional coaching).

                    <p>
                        <strong>AI Coach Specialization:</strong> Each of the 6 coaches feels genuinely different and
                        expert-level. The Fitness Coach provides specific workout plans, the Career Coach gives
                        actionable salary negotiation strategies, the Finance Coach offers personalized budgeting
                        advice—all powered by carefully crafted system prompts.

                        <strong>RevenueCat Best Practices:</strong> Learned the importance of proper product
                        configuration, the difference between offerings and packages, and how to structure entitlements
                        for maximum flexibility. Understanding the RevenueCat dashboard and its integration with App
                        Store Connect was crucial.

                        <strong>AI Prompt Engineering:</strong> Discovered that effective AI coaching requires more than
                        just good prompts—it requires understanding the domain, anticipating user needs, and crafting
                        responses that are both expert-level and accessible. Each coach's personality emerged through
                        iterative refinement.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Minimalist Design Principles:</strong> Learned that minimalism isn't about removing
                        features—it's about removing friction. Every element should serve a purpose, every animation
                        should provide feedback, every screen should guide the user naturally to their goal.

                        was invaluable.

                        <strong>Long-term Vision:</strong> Nirvan aims to become the "Spotify of Personal Development"—a
                        single platform where anyone can access world-class coaching across every life domain,
                        personalized to their unique goals and circumstances. By democratizing access to expert
                        guidance, we envision a world where personal growth is not a luxury for the wealthy, but a
                        fundamental right accessible to everyone, everywhere, at any time.
